## Key Features

+ Point-to-Point Navigation:
  - The robot can be directed to move from one specific point to another within its workspace with high accuracy, allowing precise positioning and movement control.
+ Defined Shape Path Tracking:
  - Users can define common shapes such as circles or rectangles, along with parameters like radius or centroid, and the robot will autonomously follow the specified path, allowing for consistent and repeatable movements.
+ Custom Path Tracking:
  - Users can define custom paths, including complex shapes or specific trajectories, and the robot will execute the desired path, incorporating obstacle avoidance and other advanced motion planning techniques.
+ User-friendly Interface:
  - The robot's control system incorporates an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for programming, controlling, and monitoring the robot's actions, simplifying the user's interaction and ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow.
  

## Future work
1. Implement PID control optimizations to achieve faster motion with high precision, enhancing the manipulator's overall performance.
Develop a homing feature that allows the manipulator to return to a predefined home position upon power-up, ensuring consistent and predictable starting conditions.
2. Integrate keyboard and joystick control options to provide alternative methods for controlling the manipulator, offering flexibility and user convenience.
3. Create a workspace visualization feature that enables users to monitor the manipulator's workspace through graphical representation, enhancing spatial awareness and facilitating efficient task planning.
4. Incorporate autonomous obstacle avoidance capabilities, where the manipulator can intelligently plan its motion based on pre-defined obstacle positions, ensuring safe and efficient operation.
5. Implement a teach mode functionality that enables users to physically move the manipulator and record positions, allowing for easy creation and playback of saved motions."
